<h1>Git/GitHub Project - Fenix D</h1>
<p><b>Version Control</b> is important because it helps a programming team keep track of the possible changes that may have occured.
  This allows developers to go back and look at previous version in case a mistake occurs.
  Disruption amongst team members is also diminished while searching for a mistake.

<p><b>Git</b> is a locally installed version control tool that assists in managing the history of a source code.
  <b>GitHub</b>, on the other hand, is a cloud based service that stores code used by the Git tool. It also allows for easier collaboration on projects.
